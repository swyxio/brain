# How to Try Out Async React today

I have to put the requisite disclaimer that you shouldn't do this for anything in production. If you just want to tinker, any version after [16.4.0-alpha.0911da3](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/issues/890#issuecomment-371846088) is good.

Here is a short guide to [Try React Suspense in 5 Minutes](https://dev.to/swyx/how-to-try-react-suspense-in-5-minutes-474c).
