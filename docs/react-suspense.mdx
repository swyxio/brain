# React Suspense

React Suspense is a generic way for components to suspend rendering while they load data from a cache.

**Problems it solves**: When rendering is **I/O-bound**.

## Important Concepts

- Reading from a cache during render
  - **suspending** on cache miss to fetch data
  - showing a **fallback** UI if the duration of the suspense exceeds a threshold
  - **resuming** render when the fetch is fulfilled and the cache read obtains a value
- Render is only complete and committed to the DOM when either:
  - `maxDuration` is exceeded and the **fallback** UI is shown.
  - OR: all sibling and child suspenders within a `<Suspense>` boundary have resolved. In other words, they "render together or not at all".

Cache implementations are independent of React Suspense; 
the React team maintains a reference implementation called `react-cache` 
that also supports key-based invalidation and preloading but they are not strictly necessary for React Suspense to work.

Caches should be idempotent and should **throw promises** to resolve data fetches.

## `<Suspense>` Example 

*Current API: `React.unstable_Suspense`*

`<Suspense>` sets a "catchment area" for all suspenders thrown by its children.

```js
// inside render...
  <Suspense maxDuration={1000} fallback={<Spinner size="medium" />}>
    <ChildComponent id={id} />
  </Suspense>
```

`<Suspense>` works without `ConcurrentMode`, but will act as though `maxDuration` is always 0 (i.e. it will always show the fallback UI even if momentarily, just like in normal React)

Please see our `react-cache` section for how to write suspenders.
