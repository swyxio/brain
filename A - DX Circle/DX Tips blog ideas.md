- 0 to 1 devrel (kin)
- service devrel (solana)
- fill-in devrel (sentry)
2x2 based on existing growth vs centricity (focused on demoing platform or teaching code)

## taylor barnett 

solo devrel - only one on the team, how to say no
community/produt focused devrel
offer anonymojs because she needs plusbile deniability from prev job

## the overly discerning developer

- lots of reasons why the mass market thing isnt good enough
- uses the niche thing
- isnt 

## what it feels like to be early

- “this wasnt even a job”
- your friends getting higher pay doing something else
- adhoc scripts
- one person doing the job holding all the context
- theres a utility library for it
- theres a framework for it
- lots of startups https://stratechery.com/2020/the-end-of-the-beginning/ - pmarca says no startups are wrong


## why livestream

why livestream - no views. but reacting live

## stripe lessons


t1 decisions (eg cross teams ) - review after 1-3-9 months

writing/documentation culture

no feature flags

gavel process - most junior to most senior bc everyone has voice in

lunch time no decision


## the tradeoffs of open source

mergent conversafion with james martinez vs what we learned at temporal
building 2 of everything
tendency to make it as hard to use as possible
devrel for open source

You _can_ have the best of both worlds, but it takes a new kind of DevOps tool, truly **designed for the modern cloud.**

Ambassador Labs (formerly Datawire), the cloud native developer experience leader, enables developers to code, ship, and run applications faster and easier than ever.

https://readyset.io/blog/%5Bslug%5D 
- Our mission is to help developers build faster applications without writing extra code.
- ReadySet is building a SQL caching engine that sits in front of existing databases and dramatically improves database performance by accelerating reads. It supports millions of queries per second with sub-millisecond latencies on a single node, all while keeping cached state up-to-date automatically. Any time a write changes the data in the underlying database ReadySet automatically updates any affected cached query results. ReadySet is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres and can be used with existing applications without code changes. It is a simpler and more cost effective alternative to homegrown caching layers and read replica hierarchies. See our documentation for more information!

### devrel, dev evangelism
https://thenewstack.io/devrel-and-the-increasing-popularity-of-the-developer-advocate/


1. How do you measure success?
2. How hard is it to go back to full time engineering?
3. How do you choose what to work on? (blogging, internal evangelism, conferences, demos)
4. How important is experience with the technology you’re evangelizing?
5. What do you look for when choosing a role?
6. Why would someone consider DevRel over engineering?



### developer content trade school
- art of software gets less traction
- than how to React in 2021
- The fundamental problem of developer content creation: "How to do React in 2021" gets 100x more views than "How to write software so you can maintain it for 10 years".
- The fundamental solution? write one paper with main thesis and then apply it a billion times
- https://twitter.com/timsoulo/status/1506405833965408257?s=21
- things you can try
	- build demo app
		- jamie from convex - "look at us get a thing done"
		- generate blogpost

Identify high leverage pieces of content that require the least amount of time and effort to produce. Ideally we would focus on repurposing well established but minimally visible content.

### a modest proposal for developer experience

lace everything with cocaine

### hard problems working on platforms
- stability work is zero value by default, justification comes from hard-to-reverse damage whereas feature work is overstated
- want to keep growing by adding features, but vast majority of users will just use three
- users you want to reach dont appreciate the problem you solve
	- supprot - pple blaming you for their problems 
- you want to commoditize complements/be switzerland but your users want a clear community
- extensibility and plugins - first x then y
- open source - users and operators
- multiple compile destinations
	- xbrowser difficulties https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1505401925184991235?s=21
	- lowest common denominators 
- https://skamille.medium.com/product-for-internal-platforms-9205c3a08142
	- But the platform team doesn’t build solutions for only one user. The whole value of a platform team is providing broadly-useful systems, so we are rarely presented with a well-specified need to fill.
	-  In a perfect world, platform product managers are regularly using the products they support in order to identify pain points and gaps that engineers might miss and users may not complain about. In the real world it’s hard to find time to use your products in anger when you are also dealing with all the other parts of the PM job.

## theory of value in devtools

cf sarah cataranzo convo

- alx rampell - "operating systems thesis" - system of truth
- value creation via economic leverage
- people replacement
- broken politics
- 3 layer cake - infra, platform, app 
- wardley map
- aggregation theory

## what if dev marketing worked like tv commercials
- as seen  on TV
- how does it work?

## competing against DIY
- oso's post on why authz is hard
- scrapingbee scraping
- greenspunning https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29891428#29921433

## growing UGC at devtools
- job postings
- case studies
- blogposts
- tweets

## devtools uncanny valley
- either small api surface area
- or extremely opinionated all in one
- in between require too much work for the value or are not flexible enough

## marketing to developers

- answer what's the catch
- hook into known hard problems eg cap theorem

## selling a programming paradigm
- fp vs oop
- sql vs nosql
- jamstack
- devops


## things developers want
- performance
- cost
- "scale"
- simplicity

## competing against DIY
